# Tennis-model-predictor
 I have built a model that predicts tennis matches based on ELO ratings. As I have seen it has more accurate predictions than ATP rating. Code is written in Python. 

 Free to use model, enjoy. If you see a way to improve it do it and message me about it. 

 Website I used to import the first ELO ratings: https://tennisabstract.com/reports/atp_elo_ratings.html

 This website helped describe how the ELO works and why it is better than ATP rankings: https://www.tennisabstract.com/blog/2019/12/03/an-introduction-to-tennis-elo/
