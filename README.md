# Tennis-model-predictor
 I have built a model that predicts tennis matches based on ELO ratings. As I have seen it has more accurate predictions than ATP rating. 
 
 Website I used to import the first ELO ratings: https://tennisabstract.com/reports/atp_elo_ratings.html

 This website helped describe how the ELO works and why it is better than ATP rankings: https://www.tennisabstract.com/blog/2019/12/03/an-introduction-to-tennis-elo/

 Requirements:

 Python 3.10+
 Install dependencies: pip install pandas openpyxl
 You need these files: tennis_prediction.py (the Python script), elo_ranking.xlsx (EXCEL sheet with loaded data)
 These files need to be in the same folder.

 From then on you need to open and run the script, eneter the stuff needed like player names, surface and is the tournament with sets of 3 or sets of 5. 

 I have loaded only men's ranking. The website offers women's and couple's ranking too.

 To keep the code running right, you should update the EXCEL file as time passes because ELO will change as soon as a match is played by a player. 

 I have loaded only the top 490 players so if your favourite is playing against somebody not on the list you will need to either calculate their ELO based on formula or change the code and add more data to use it.
